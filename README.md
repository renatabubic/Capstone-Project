## Game Rules

1. Player-1 creates the game room and shares the game code with minimum 1 player and maximum 3 more players and initiates the game.
2. Each player playing as a Pac-Man munches his way around the maze, eating the small Pac dots, Power Pellets and food.
3. There are some scattered Power Pellets which when the Pac-Man eats, turns into a big Pac-Man for 10 seconds.
4. Big Pac-Man can eat other small Pac-Man and ghosts.
5. Once a small Pac-Man gets big, 1 ghost is released and turns weak changing its color to blue.
6. Speed of the big Pac-Man is more than the small Pac-Man and the ghosts.
7. The big Pac-Man starts flashing two seconds prior to changing back to small version.
8. When more than one Pac-Man turns big, all the big Pac Men simultaneously return to their small version 10 seconds after the first Pac-Man eats the Power Pellet.
9. When the same size Pac-Man collides, they bounce off each other in opposite direction.
10. Small Pac-Man leaves the round when it lands on a big Pac-man or a ghost.
11. Ghost turns into a pair of eyes and returns to its cage when eaten by a big Pac-Man.
12. When the Pac-Man eats all the food, the whole maze is renewed with food, dots and Power Pellet.
13. In each round, level winner is announced to the last Pac-Man who survives in the level and is awarded a score of 1 point.
14. The player who collects the highest score after all the rounds is declared the Winner of the game!
